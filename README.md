# Trivia Hero

A responsive web application where you can practice your trivia skills. You can find a deployed version of this repository here: [Trivia Hero](https://trivia-hero-ta.herokuapp.com/). This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How To Run

You can run the app by following the next steps:
- 'npm install' dependencies
- 'npm start' to get it running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- 'npm test' to run the unit tests currently written

## Future Implementations

 Trivia Hero is still under construction. For the future, I would like to incorporate the following features:
 - creating a database where I can save the data, and have it fetch by http requests via express routes
 - additional unit testing 
 - continue to work on UI/UX and responsiveness of the application
 - login/logout functionality
 - share your results on social media feature (for the fun of it!)
